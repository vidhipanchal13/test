                    Poetry writing is something that gives me comfort and helps me relax.......
                    Another thing that helps me relax is reading books.

                    While many people have dreams of becoming doctors and lawyers also engineer, I have
                    wanted to be a writer. 
                    <br><br>
                    I donâ€™t remember when I fell in love with poetry...but over the years, my passion for
                     writing has increased.
